//I love how you light up small moments—flowers at the store, goofy mini-golf swings, and how hard you laugh when Tundra goes full zoomies. Thanks for letting me call you Unc and still putting up with my “you’re old” jokes.

//This year, I hope you get cozy mornings, easy wins, and a million little reasons to smile. Also: Mitzi insists on extra cuddles.
